# Typography Responsive Font Sizes

Responsive font size tokens ensure that typography adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, providing optimal readability and visual hierarchy on any device. Each token represents a specific text style (such as Title, Display) and defines its font size and line height for various breakpoints (e.g., small, medium, extra-large screens). By using these tokens, designers and developers can maintain consistency and scalability in their interfaces.

> **Developer Hint:**
> The tokens shown below (such as `display-01`, `title-01`, etc.) are **custom class names** and are **not defined in the default Tailwind CSS configuration**.
> You can use these token names directly as class names (e.g., `<span className="display-01">...</span>`) **without** the `text-` prefix that Tailwind uses for its own font size utilities.
> For font weight, you can use Tailwind's built-in utilities like `font-normal`, `font-medium`, etc., alongside these token classes.
