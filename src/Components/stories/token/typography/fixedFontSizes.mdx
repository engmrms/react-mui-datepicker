# Typography Fixed Font Sizes

Fixed font size tokens ensure that typography maintains consistent sizes across all screen sizes, providing a uniform visual hierarchy. Each token represents a specific text style (such as Caption, Subtitle, or Body) and defines its font size and line height. By using these tokens, designers and developers can maintain consistency and scalability in their interfaces.

> **Developer Hint:**
> The tokens shown below (such as `caption-01`, `subtitle-01`, etc.) are **defined in the Tailwind CSS configuration** and are available as standard Tailwind font size utilities.
> You can use these token names with the `text-` prefix (e.g., `<span className="text-caption-01">...</span>`) just like any other Tailwind font size class.
> For font weight, you can use Tailwind's built-in utilities like `font-normal`, `font-medium`, etc., alongside these token classes.
